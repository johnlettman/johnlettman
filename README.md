## 👋 Hello there, and thank you for stopping by!

I'm John P. Lettman, a developer passionate about geospatial data, embedded systems, robotics, and hardware integration.
Here you'll find FOSS projects ranging from libraries for LIDAR and sonar hardware to tools for processing OpenStreetMap data.

If you find anything I've made useful, please let me know! It's always awesome to hear that my work can help contribute to someone else's projects. :)

## Open to Work
_Are you currently hiring folks with my experience?_

Please feel free to contact me via [any of the methods below](#get-in-touch)!

### About me & what I’m looking for:
I specialize in systems-level and low-level software development, with strong experience in C, C++, Golang, Rust, and Python. I have extensive knowledge of Linux systems across both cloud and embedded environments, as well as hands-on experience building robotics and sensor-driven applications. Outside of that, I could be described as a generalist, with familiarity with wide variety of environments (e.g., TypeScript + React.js).

## What I'm Working On
I'm exploring robust, cross-platform solutions for sensor data acquisition.
At the moment, I love pushing the boundaries of what can be accomplished in resource-constrained environments using Rust.

## Tech Stack
- **Domains**: Embedded Systems, Robotics, Sensors, GIS, Geospatial data, Hardware APIs
- **Languages**: Rust, Golang, C, C++, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and a few others.
